# Overview

[Face The music](https://sharpryan20.github.io/ci-project-2/) is my Portfolio 2 project. I was originally given some examples that I could use when first designing my project and one of the examples was to design a quiz. I decided to use that example and ended up creating 'Face the music.

It is a quiz that challenges and entertains music lovers as they struggle to think of the song from a snippet of lyrics.

The site is fully responsive on all devices and the site is generated through HTML.
